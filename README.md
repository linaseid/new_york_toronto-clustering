# new_york_toronto-clustering
We will cluster New York City and the city of Toronto neighbourghoods. In the clusters we will see how similar or dissimilar they are.

1)  Gather information about New York City and Toronto on the same format 

Borough	Neighborhood	Latitude	Longitude

2) Use the Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods in New York City and Toronto. 
We  will use the explore function to get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood, 
and then use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters. We will use the k-means clustering algorithm to complete this task.
